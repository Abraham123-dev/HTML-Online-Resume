    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Full stack developer with frontend developer focus. I love learning
      by building, improving every day, and working on projects that solve real
      problems. My goal is to grow into a developer who writes clean code and
      builds useful, real-world solutions. I’m exploring Artificial
      Intelligence, Web3, and crypto, with interest in smart contracts and
      decentralized applications.
